Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They can be classified into three main categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns.
Each category addresses different aspects of object-oriented software design.

### Creational Patterns
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation. 
The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity, and creational patterns solve this problem by controlling the object creation process.

1. **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
   - **Use case**: When you need exactly one instance of a class to coordinate actions across the system.
   
2. **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
   - **Use case**: When the exact type of the object isn’t known until runtime.

3. **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
   - **Use case**: When a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.

4. **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
   - **Use case**: When you need to create a complex object step by step.

5. **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.
   - **Use case**: When the cost of creating a new object is more expensive than copying an existing one.

### Structural Patterns
Structural patterns deal with object composition, typically identifying simple ways to realize relationships between different objects.

1. **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
   - **Use case**: When you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.

2. **Bridge**: Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
   - **Use case**: When you need to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

3. **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
   - **Use case**: When you need to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.

4. **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
   - **Use case**: When you need to add responsibilities to individual objects without affecting other objects.

5. **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
   - **Use case**: When you need to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem.

6. **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
   - **Use case**: When many fine-grained objects need to be created efficiently.

7. **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
   - **Use case**: When you need a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity.

### Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns deal with communication between objects, focusing on the interaction between them and the way in which responsibilities are distributed.

1. **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers.
   - **Use case**: When more than one object can handle a request and the handler isn’t known a priori.

2. **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
   - **Use case**: When you need to parameterize objects with operations, queue operations, and request operations at different times.

3. **Interpreter**: Defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.
   - **Use case**: When you need to interpret a language, especially if the grammar is simple.

4. **Iterator**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
   - **Use case**: When you need to access elements of a collection without exposing the underlying structure.

5. **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
   - **Use case**: When objects communicate in well-defined but complex ways and there are dependencies between them.

6. **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
   - **Use case**: When you need to restore an object to its previous state.

7. **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
   - **Use case**: When an object’s state change must be communicated to other objects.

8. **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
   - **Use case**: When an object must change its behavior at runtime depending on its state.

9. **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
   - **Use case**: When you need to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch between them.

10. **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
    - **Use case**: When you have an invariant part of an algorithm and steps that can be extended or overridden by subclasses.

11. **Visitor**: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
    - **Use case**: When you need to perform operations across a heterogeneous collection of objects without changing the objects themselves.
