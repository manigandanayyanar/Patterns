The Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class, 
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. 

It's useful when you need to create an instance of a class from a family of classes based on some criteria or configuration.

Decide your class object at runtime based on your input.
